# This config file is loaded by the node-config package (see dependencies in package.json)
#   if the NODE_ENV environment variable is set to 'prd' from the Deploy-prd.yml workflow (github action).
#   Therefore, there is no need of the src/environments folder as the environment is set prior to app build
